Project Titan: Q3 2023 Update

Project Titan is on track to meet its key objectives for the third quarter. The engineering team, led by Bob, successfully completed the alpha version of the core module. The final cost for this phase was $120,000, which is 5% under budget.

The sales team, consisting of David and Eve, secured two new major clients, bringing the total projected annual revenue to $1.5 million. The marketing team will launch the new campaign in early November.

Key risks include potential supply chain disruptions and a new competitor entering the market. Mitigation plans are being developed.
